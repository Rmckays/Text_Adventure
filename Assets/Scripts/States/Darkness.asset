  storyText: 'You continue to fumble around in the darkness.  The ruddy light of
    the tunnel grows fainter as you move into the darkness. Your hands slide onto
    a smooth hard object. Without your vision you aren''t sure what it is.


    1.
    Let your hands continue to explore this new object.

    2. God knows what that
    is! Pull your hand back and move further into the darkness.'
