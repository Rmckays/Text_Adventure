  storyText: 'Your hands continue to explore the strange smooth object. Your hands
    slide over small spike like appendages under the rounded smooth top. The spikes
    move and you realize your mistake. You have just grabbed a giant centipede. 
    The ferocious anthropod scuttles over you before you can react. Its spike like
    legs puncture through your skin and the last thing you feel before darkness takes
    you is vice like mandibles clamping over your head.


    1. Game Over'
