  storyText: 'You open your eyes to darkness. You don''t remember who you are or
    how you got here. You push yourself up off the cold dark stone. It is pitch black
    except for a faint light coming from off to your left. You can see the faint
    outline of a tunnel in the ruddy light.


    1. Stand and make your way over
    to the faint tunner.

    2. Continue to fumble around on your hands and knees
    in the darkness.'
